The purpose of this lab is to introduce students to using micro-controller for basic real-time
(RT) system and the basic tools used by embedded system engineers: oscilloscope and function
generator. The oscilloscope used to troubleshoot electronic systems. Additionally, real-embedded
system signals are too complex (e.g., sensor data) and difficult to to analyze. The function
generator is used to generate electronic signals with specific known characteristics, thereby
enabling an engineer to test and examine a circuit. Finally, you will use a micro-controller to
implement specification of a simple interrupt controlled system.
