4-bit LED binary counter. The counter counts from 0 to 15 (0000 to 1111) using LEDs (e.g., a digital 5 is 0101, which implies that LED1
and LED3 are ON, and other LEDs are OFF). Four LEDs and two switches are connected to
micro-controller (MCU):

• LED 1 (D1) is connected to GPIO #1 of the MCU
• LED 2 (D2) is connected to GPIO #2 of the MCU
• LED 3 (D3) is connected to GPIO #3 of the MCU
• LED 4 (D4) is connected to GPIO #4 of the MCU
• A push button switch (SW1) is connected to GPIO #5 of the MCU
• A push button switch (SW2) is connected to GPIO #6 of the MCU
